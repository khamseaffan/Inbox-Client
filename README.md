# Inbox Client Workspace

## ðŸ“¬ Description

This repository defines a modular protocol-based interface for email clients (e.g., Gmail, Hotmail). It uses Python `Protocol` classes to describe standardised, mockable interfaces for both messages and inbox clients.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.10 or higher**
- `pytest` for testing
- `mypy` for type checking
- `ruff` for linting
- `uv` (for dependency and workspace management)
- `coverage`

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khamseaffan/Inbox-Client.git
   cd Inbox-Client

2. Install UV, the package manager for dependency management:
   For macOS/linux

   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

   Alternatively, for brew installation: [brew install uv](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/uv) is sufficient.

   For Windows

   ```bash
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```
